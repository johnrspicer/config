Graduated in 2010, and for the past few years I've been teaching. I was among the last batch of humans who will remember what the world was like before the internet. Before cellphones, social media, and constant connectivity, the complete reformatting of the human mind. The average human's identity is now just as rooted in digital personas as it is in the physical world. In a realm where there is no action, only words, your words become your actions. More and more the physical world seems to shrink, becoming beholden to things that do not exist. The future becomes enslaved to an eternally expanding record of anything and everything, the past now meaningfully indistinguishable from the present. Every day I speak with kids who are incapable of conceptualizing a world without this. It colors their expectations for themselves and society, robs them of true interpersonal moments, limits their ability to think and feel. Nothing ever really ends or disappears for them, and so value is impossible. Some things are preferable over others in the moment, but art, entertainment, culture, information itself is as disposable as oxygen. It is all just stimulation. "Content." I love these kids. I can see their humanity in there, unsatisfied and starved for something they don't even know how to name. The ability to shut it all down, I think. They want to go back, too.
